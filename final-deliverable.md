# CS1680 - Snowcast with GRPC and React
**Members:** Jenny Yu and Tianren Dong

**Goal:** Understand how GRPC works and use it to implement Snowcast. For GRPC to work with commonly used frontend frameworks such as React, there needs to be a proxy between frontend and backend. As a stretch goal, we hope to set up the Envoy proxy and implement a React frontend for it.

## GRPC
What GRPC is, how it compares to self-implemented protocols, and how it compares to HTTP APIs

## Using Proxy to connect GRPC with Frontend 
How GRPC works with frontend frameworks and how to set up the proxy

## Streaming Music Data

## Learning Process
